# Citrine Hair Studio

I built this site for a friend's hair salon. I originally built this site on Squarespace, but the client decided she wanted something more unique so this is what we came up with!  It's always a work in progress.  

## Tech Stack

It uses Express/Node.js with EJS templating and is deployed live through Heroku.  The site has responsive features as well, so if you are viewing from a desktop, check out the mobile version, and vice-versa.
