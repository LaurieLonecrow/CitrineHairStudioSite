I built this site for a friend's hair salon. It uses Express/Node.js with EJS templating and is deployed live through Heroku.  I originally built this site on Squarespace, but the client decided she wanted something more unique so this is what we came up with!  It's always a work in progress.  Take a look here: https://citrine-hair-studio.herokuapp.com/  The site has responsive features as well, so if you are viewing from a desktop, check out the mobile version, and vice-versa.
